# Mail-Server-WebApplication

this is the final version and my task was front-end using Vue.js

Front-end with Vue.js and Back-end with spring-boot

to run this project you need to run 

-the Front-end Folder by Vue CLI(should be in localhost:8081)port:8081

-the Back-end folder by any java IDE(should be in localhost:8080)port:8080
